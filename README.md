### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Wilder (a Wild Code School student) in Data Analyst Intensive training since September 2021 for 5 months
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQL, statistics and everything I need to become a great data analyst. So much projects, so much to learn ... as soon as I find time, I promise to update my GitHub with all my projects ... See you soon! ;-)
